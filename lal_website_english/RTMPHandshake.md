## Interaction sequence

- Client sends c0+c1 to server
- Server sends s0+s1+s2 to client
- Client sends c2 to server

Note that some servers receive c2 before sending s2.

### Length
c0 and s0 are both 1 byte c1 and c2 and s1 and s2 are both 1536 bytes.

### Two modes
There are two modes of RTMP handshake: **simple mode** and **complex mode**.

The following table is the handshake modes used by some common RTMP client programs and software that I have compiled.

| Name                         | Mode    |
|------------------------------|---------|
| OBS push stream              | Simple  |
| VLC player pull stream       | Complex |
| mpv player pull stream       | Complex |
| ffmpeg push/pull stream      | Complex |
| nginx-rtmp-module push/pull  | Complex |

The RTMP server should normally support both modes. (Otherwise it would be awkward if RTMP clients using one of the modes could handshake and the other couldn't.)

This document mainly refers to the implementation of `nginx-rtmp-module` (hereafter referred to as `nrm`) to lal implementation. `nrm`, as an RTMP open source server, has a handshake implementation when acting as a server. It also has a handshake implementation as a client since it supports relaying. lal is my own streaming server written in Go, which supports the RTMP protocol. RTMP handshake implementation is written with reference to `nrm`. The internal RTMP client handshake uses simple mode. rtmp server handshake supports both modes. lal github address: https://github.com/q191201771/lal

This single byte for c0 and s0 is the version number, which is the same for both simple and complex modes. It is fixed to `0x03`. c1 and c2 and s1 and s2 have different formats in both modes.

s1 can be seen as a reply to c1 and c2 as a reply to s2.

The `nrm` refers to c0c1 and s0s1 as CHALLENGE and c2 and s2 as RESPONSE.

### Simple mode
See [spec-rtmp_specification_1.0.pdf](https://github.com/q191201771/doc/blob/master/spec-rtmp_specification_1.0.pdf)

### c0 and s0
Version numbers, fixed to `0x03`.

### c1 and s1

    | 4-byte timestamp time | 4-byte all-0 binary string | 1528-byte random binary string |

The top 4-byte timestamp is typically in milliseconds.

When `nrm` is acting as a client, time in c1 uses the millisecond portion of the current Unix timestamp. When `nrm` acts as a server, if the client is judged to be in simple mode, it does not use the timestamp in c1 after parsing it. When sending s1, it is returning the 1536 bytes of c1 as is.

With the 4-byte binary string of all zeros, the server can determine that the client is using simple mode.

### c2 and s2
    | 4-byte timestamp time | 4-byte time2 | 1528-byte random binary string |

As per the documentation:

c2's time should be set to the time field in s1. c2's time2 should be set to the point in time when s1 was received. The time of s2 should be set to the time field in c1. time2 of s2 should be set to the point in time when c1 was received.

When `nrm` is used as a server, if the client is judged to be in simple mode, the 1536 bytes of c1 are returned as is when s2 is sent.

If you use the OBS client (OBS uses simple handshake mode) to handshake with the `nrm` server, you will find that the entire 1536 bytes of c1, c2, s1, and s2 are identical. This shows that, for the fields `time` and `time2`, `nrm` doesn't do exactly what the documentation says.

### Complex Mode

#### HMAC-SHA256

Before introducing complex mode, a hash signature algorithm is introduced, the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm. Complex mode will use it to do some signature operations and verification.

Briefly, the input of this algorithm is a **key** (length can be arbitrary) and an **input string** (length can be arbitrary). The HMAC-SHA256 operation results in a 32-byte signature string.

When the key and input are fixed, the HMAC-SHA256 result is also fixed and unique.

##### c0
Fixed to `0x03`.

##### c1
The format is as follows:

    | 4-byte timestamp time | 4-byte mode string | 1528-byte complex binary string |

The 4-byte timestamp time field is described with reference to time in simple mode. `ffmpeg` uses `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.

4-byte pattern string, `nrm` uses `[0x0C, 0x00, 0x0D, 0x0E]`. `ffmpeg` uses `[9, 0, 124, 2]`.

The 1528-byte complex binary string generation rules are as follows:

- Step one: Randomise the 1528 byte complex binary string.
- Step two: Write a 32-byte digest signature in the 1528-byte random binary string.

#### Location of digest

Firstly, we explain how the location of digest is determined. The digest can be located in the first half or in the second half.

When digest is in the first half, the location information of digest (hereafter referred to as offset) is stored at the start of the first half.

The c1 format is expanded as follows:

    | 4-byte time | 4-byte pattern string | 4-byte offset | left[...] | 32 bytes digest | right[...] | 764 bytes for the second half 
    
    offset = (c1[8] + c1[9] + c1[10] + c1[11]) % 728 + 12

The calculated offset is relative to the starting position of the entire c1.

The reason for the balance of 728 is because the first half of the 764 bytes is subtracted from the 4 bytes of the offset field, and then subtracted from the 32 bytes of digest. The reason for adding 12 is to skip 4 bytes of time + 4 bytes of pattern string + 4 bytes of offset.

The value range of offset is `[12,740)`.

When offset=12, the left part does not exist, and when offset=739, the right part does not exist.

When digest is in the second half, offset is saved at the start of the second half.

The c1 format is expanded as follows:

    | 4-byte time | 4-byte pattern string | 764-byte first half | 4-byte offset | left[...] | 32 bytes digest | right[...] | 4 bytes offset = (c1[8+8])

    offset = (c1[8+764] + c1[8+764+1] + c1[8+764+2] + c1[8+764+3]) % 728 + 8 + 764 + 4

The computed offset dependency is relative to the actual position of c1.

Why take the remainder 728? Because the second half of the 764 bytes is subtracted from the 4 bytes of the offset field, and then subtracted from the 32 bytes of digest.

Why add 8 plus 764 plus 4? It's because you have to skip 4 bytes of time + 4 bytes of pattern string + 764 bytes of the first half + 4 bytes of offset.

The value range of offset is `[776,1504)`.

When offset=776, the left part does not exist, and when offset=1503, the right part does not exist.

When `nrm` constructs c1 as a client, it uses the first format, where digest is placed in the first half.

#### How digest is generated

After talking about the location of digest, let's talk about how the digest is generated.

That is, the left part of the c1 digest is spliced with the right part of the c1 digest (if the right part exists) as HMAC-SHA256 input (the size of the whole is 1536-32), the following size of 30 bytes of a fixed key as the HMAC-SHA256 key, through the HMAC-SHA256 calculations to derive a 32-byte digest which is filled into the digest field in c1.

    'G', 'e', 'n', 'u', 'i', 'n', 'e', ' ', 'A', 'd', 'o', 'b', 'e', ' ', '
    'f', 'l', 'a', 's', 'h', ' ', 'p', 'l', 'a', 'y', 'e', 'r', ' ','
    '0', '0', '1'.

After receiving c1, the server side will first pass the mode string in c1 to initially determine whether it is a complex mode, and if it is a complex mode, it will re-digest through c1 to see whether the calculated digest is the same as the contained digest field in c1 to determine whether the handshake is a complex mode.

Note that since the server cannot directly know whether the client puts digest in the first half or the second half, the server can only verify one of them first, and if the verification fails, then verify the other, and if they both fail, consider backing off to use the simple mode to continue the handshake with the client.

##### s0
Fixed to `0x03`.

##### s1
The construction method of s1 is the same as c1. Only the pattern string is replaced with `[0x0D, 0x0E, 0x0A, 0x0D]`. And replace the HMAC-SHA256 key with the following 36-byte fixed key:

    'G', 'e', 'n', 'u', 'i', 'n', 'e', ' ', 'A', 'd', 'o', 'b', 'e', ' ', '
    'f', 'l', 'a', 's', 'h', ' ', 'm', 'e', 'd', 'i', 'a', ' '.
    's', 'e', 'r', 'v', 'e', 'r', ' ','
    '0', '0', '1', '

##### s2
The format is as follows:

    | 4-byte timestamp time | 4-byte time2 | 1528-byte random binary string |

where the `time` and `time2` fields refer to the description of s2 in simple mode.

The 1528-byte random binary string also needs to be filled with a digest.

In practice, `nrm` fills the 32-byte digest directly into the end of s2, i.e., the corresponding offset is not set. digest is computed by using the left part of digest as the HMAC-SHA256 input (size is 1536-32), using the digest in c1 as the HMAC-SHA256 key, and calculate digest by HMAC-SHA256.

##### c2
The construction method of c2 is the same as s2. Only it uses the digest in s2 as the HMAC-SHA256 key.
