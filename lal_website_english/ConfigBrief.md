# lalserver configuration file description

The lalserver configuration file is in JSON format.  

In order to make it easier to read and find, this document uses two forms of describing the configuration file:

- The annotated version keeps the original format of the JSON file and adds comments at the end of each line.
- The descriptive version uses the first level of sub-items as a separate header, and the internal block contains its sub-items.

For details see: [Dummy audio](dummy_audio.md)

#### ✸ "in_session/add_dummy_audio_enable"

Type: bool

Type: bool  
Value example: true

Whether to enable HTTPS-FLV listening or not.

#### ✸ "httpflv/url_pattern"

Type: string  
Value example: "/"

The address of the pull stream URL routing path.

Defaults to `/`, which means it is unrestricted and the route address can be any path.  
If set to `/live/`, streams can only be pulled from the `/live/` path, e.g. `/live/test110.flv`.

#### ✸ "httpflv/gop_num"

Type: int  
Value example: 0

GOP caching for the HTTPFLV protocol, the meaning is similar to `rtmp.gop_num`.

#### ✸ "httpflv/single_gop_max_frame_num"

Type: int  
Value example: 0

See `rtmp.single_gop_max_frame_num`

### ▌ "hls"

#### ✸ "hls/enable"

Type: bool  
Value Example: true

Whether to enable listening for the HLS service.

#### ✸ "hls/enable_https"

Type: bool  
Value example: true

Whether to enable HTTPS-HLS listening.

#### ✸ "hls/url_pattern"

Type: string  
Value example: "/hls/"

Pull stream URL routing address, defaults to `/hls/`, the corresponding HLS (m3u8) pull stream URLs are:

- `/hls/{streamName}.m3u8`
- `/hls/{streamName}/playlist.m3u8`
- `/hls/{streamName}/record.m3u8`

The `playlist.m3u8` file corresponds to live HLS and only `<fragment_num>` TS file names are stored in the list, which is continuously incremented.  
Newly generated TS files are added and outdated ones are removed.

The `record.m3u8` file corresponds to recording HLS, listing all TS files from the first (oldest) TS file to the latest generated TS file; newly generated TS files will be constantly appended to the list.

The address of the TS file uses the following template:

- `/hls/{streamName}/{streamName}-{timestamp}-{index}.ts` or
- `/hls/{streamName}-{timestamp}-{index}.ts`.

Note that the `url_pattern` of HLS cannot be the same as the `url_pattern` of HTTPFLV or HTTPTS.


#### ✸ "hls/out_path"

Type: string  
Value example: `"./lal_record/hls/"`

Output root directory for HLS m3u8 and files.


#### ✸ "hls/fragment_duration_ms"

Type: int  
Value example: 3000

Duration of a single TS file fragment, in milliseconds.


#### ✸ "hls/fragment_num"

Type: int  
Example values: 6

Number of TS files in the `playlist.m3u8` file list.

#### ✸ "hls/delete_threshold"

Type: int   
Value example: 6

Deletion threshold for TS files.

Note that it is only used if `cleanup_mode` is 2, meaning that only the most recent TS files removed from `playlist.m3u8` will be saved, any TS files expired earlier will be deleted.  
If not, the default value takes the value of `fragment_num`.  
Note that this value should not be less than 1 to avoid deleting too fast and causing playback to fail.  

#### ✸ "hls/cleanup_mode"

Type: int  
Value example: 1

HLS file cleanup mode:

0 — Do not delete m3u8+ts files, can be used for recording and other scenarios.

1 — Delete m3u8+ts files at the end of the input stream.  
  Note that the exact point in time for deletion is after the end of the push stream  
  `fragment_duration_ms * (fragment_num + delete_threshold)`.  
  Deletion is delayed for a small period of time to avoid the pull side of HLS not finishing pulling just after the input stream ends.

2 — Continuously delete outdated TS files during the push stream, keeping only the most recent ones
  `delete_threshold + fragment_num + 1`.  
  Also, at the end of the input stream, the cleanup mode 1 logic is also performed.

Note that record.m3u8 is only generated in modes 0 and 1.


#### ✸ "hls/use_memory_as_disk_flag"

Type: bool  
Value example: false

Whether to use memory instead of disk to save m3u8+ts files.  
Note that you should be careful about memory capacity when using this mode. Generally it should not be used with `cleanup_mode` of 0 or 1.


#### ✸ "hls/sub_session_timeout_ms"

Type: int  
Value example: 30000

The time in milliseconds after which the HLS player is determined to have timed out and left when counting HLS player information.  
If the value is set to 0, defaults to `fragment_num * fragment_duration_ms * 2`

#### ✸ "hls/sub_session_hash_key"

Type: string  
Example value: "q191201771"

Private key, used when calculating the unique ID of the player.  
Note that if empty, the function of counting HLS player information is disabled.

### ▌ "httpts"

#### ✸ "httpts/enable"

Type: bool  
Value Example: true

Whether to enable listening for the HTTP-TS service. Note that this is not TS in HLS, but rather the persistent transmission of TS streams over a long HTTP connection.

#### ✸ "httpts/enable_https"

Type: bool  
Value Example: true

Whether to enable HTTPS-TS listening or not.

#### ✸ "httpts/url_pattern"

Type: string  
Value example: "/"

The address of the pull stream URL routing path. The default value of `/` means that it is not restricted and the routing address can be any path address.  
If set to `/live/`, streams can only be pulled from `/live/` paths, e.g. `/live/test110.ts`.

#### ✸ "httpts/gop_num"

Type: int  
Value example: 0

See `rtmp.gop_num`.

#### ✸ "httpts/single_gop_max_frame_num"

Type: int  
Value example: 0

See `rtmp.single_gop_max_frame_num`.

### ▌ "rtsp"

#### ✸ "rtsp/enable"

Type: bool
Value example: true

Whether to enable listening for the RTSP service.


#### ✸ "rtsp/addr"

Type: string
Value example: ":5544"

RTSP listening address.


#### ✸ "rtsp/rtsps_enable"

Type: bool
Value example: true

Whether or not to enable listening for the RTSPS service.

Note that RTSP and RTSPS can be independently turned on or off.


#### ✸ "rtsp/rtsps_addr"

Type: string
Value example: ":5322"

The port address on which the RTSPS service listens.


#### ✸ "rtsp/rtsps_cert_file"

Type: string
Value example: "./conf/cert.pem"

RTSPS's local cert file.


#### ✸ "rtsp/rtsps_cert_key"

Type: string
Value example: "./conf/key.pem"

RTSPS's local key file.


#### ✸ "rtsp/out_wait_key_frame_flag"

Type: bool
Value example: true

Whether to wait for the video keyframe data before sending it when RTSP sends data.

This configuration item mainly determines the first frame, splash screen, audio/video synchronisation, etc.  
If true, both audio and video will wait for the video keyframe to be sent.  
(i.e., all audio or video is discarded and not sent until the video keyframe arrives)

If false, send both audio and video directly (i.e., neither audio nor video waits 
for the video keyframe, neither waits for any data).

Note that for audio-only streams, if this flag is true, the audio theoretically never 
waits for a video keyframe, i.e., the audio has no chance to be sent,
and if it is false, the audio is sent directly to the video.  
To avoid this, lalserver will do its best to determine if the stream is audio-only.  
If the stream is audio-only, the audio will be sent directly.  
However, if there is a pure audio stream, it is still recommended to set this configuration item to false.


#### ✸ "rtsp/auth_enable"

Type: bool
Value example: false

Whether or not to enable authentication for the RTSP service.


#### ✸ "rtsp/auth_method"

The address(es) of the relay(s) to forward the stream to, supports multiple addresses, does 1 to N forwarding.


### ▌ "static_relay_pull"

Static return pull function (this service pulls a stream from elsewhere).

When lalserver receives a pull stream sub request and the input stream does not exist, it will pull this stream locally from another server.

When there is no sub pull request, the pull request is automatically closed.  
When a pull connection fails or is disconnected, it is automatically retried.

Note that if static pullbacks don't meet your needs, it's recommended to use the HTTP API for more customised pullbacks.

Note that you should *not* use both the configuration file-controlled static repo function
*and* the HTTP API-controlled repo function at the same time.

Also, the configuration items in `static_relay_pull` have nothing to do with the HTTP API.


#### ✸ "static_relay_pull/enable"

Type: bool
Value example: false

Whether to enable this function or not. 

Note that only the static return function is controlled; if you are using the HTTP API, then it needs to be turned off there instead.


#### ✸ "static_relay_pull/addr"
