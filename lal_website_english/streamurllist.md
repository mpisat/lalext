## About ports

**Tips:** The ports in the example table are the default values in the lal configuration file, and can be modified by the user as described in the configuration file.

If you use the protocol standard port, the port in the address can be omitted, for example, the default port of HTTP is 80, then change http://127.0.0.1:80/live/test110.flv into http://127.0.0.1/live/test110.flv.

If you are not familiar with the push and pull flow client how to work with the use, you can refer to the [Common push and pull flow client information summary](CommonClient.md).
