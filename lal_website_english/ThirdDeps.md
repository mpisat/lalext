#### Source code dependencies

The only current dependency is a Go language base library that I wrote myself: [github.com/q191201771/naza](https://github.com/q191201771/naza)

#### Compilation dependencies

Go version needs to be >= 1.16. Just like any other Go program, you just need to have a Go compilation environment set up.

#### Running dependencies

No third-party dependencies. The generated executable can be run independently without any library dependencies.
